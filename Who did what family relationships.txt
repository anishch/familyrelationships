For this project, intially Josh looked over the given files and created a rough plan of work for all of us to complete. 
Then all three of us worked on writing the code - with Anish being the one actually writing down all of the base code 
and most of the methods whereas Vinay provided the logic for these methods. 
Then Josh and Anish finished testing and debugging, then Vinay wrote some comments for proper documentation.
